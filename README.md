# OKCScrape
Scrape OKC profiles into pandas DataFrames for exploration

# Info for recruiters
- Look at [profileparser.py](https://github.com/stevendevan/OKCScrape/blob/master/profileparser.py) for regex work and data extraction
- Look at my [Ipython notebook](https://github.com/stevendevan/OKCScrape/blob/master/OKCScrape_exploration.ipynb) to see how I explore data

I was considering trying to predict word counts for each user based on the other data in their profiles, but decided to leave off at EDA and focus on kaggle competitions and other projects. I may come back to do some modeling on this data at some point.
